## What is DocWeaver? {{ counter: '1' }}

DocWeaver is a tool that allows you to pull in documentation from your repositories and display them in a beautiful and easy-to-navigate website. It's like a documentation site generator, but instead of having to write markdown files by hand, you just write them in your repository and DocWeaver takes care of the rest.

A single DocWeaver server can be configured to pull in documentation from multiple repositories, allowing you to create a single source of truth for all your documentation.

## Clutter free codebase {{ counter: '3' }}

DocWeaver is focused on convention over configuration. This means as long as your `docs` folder is in the root of your repositories, DocWeaver will automatically pick it up and parse the markdown files inside.

This keeps your codebase clean and free of any dependencies and allows you to focus on writing documentation instead of configuring DocWeaver.
